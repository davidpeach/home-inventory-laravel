# Home Inventory
_Laravel Edition_

This is the Laravel version of a home inventory app.

## What is it?
It's just a simple way to search for a items, by name / tag / etc, and have the app tell you where that item is.

For example, a spade could be in a shed. Or a book could be in a box, which itself could be in the loft.

## Features
- Locations can be created
- Items can be placed into locations
- Locations themselves can be placed within locations i.e. a box in the loft
- Items can be moved
- Locations can be relocated
- Items can have a use by date
- Items can be consumable

## Why?
The plan is to build the same app but with different web frameworks, for my own learning. My thought is once I have the 
idea of what I'm building down and built in Laravel (a framework I'm familiar with) I can then look at how to 
accomplish the same things but in other frameworks and even other languages.

When I have other versions ready to share I will add a list of those versions here.
